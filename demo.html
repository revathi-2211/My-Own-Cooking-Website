    <p>Cooking is one wonderful thing one can enjoy. It is the skill and art of adding taste, flavor and beauty to the food. It has been practiced since ancient times and now has become an important part of our lives. It is not just about preparing food, but also about sharing happiness, joy and love and in fact it is the greatest hobby as well. There are different types of cooking like baking, roasting, frying, boiling etc. each type has its own importance and taste. Baking is considered as one the healthiest way to cook food. It involves the use of dry heat and baking powder or soda to make food fluffy. Roasting is also a healthy way to cook food. It uses convection heat to cook the food from all sides evenly.I love cooking and there are many reasons for me why I love it. First of all, it is a very enjoyable and relaxing activity. It makes me happy to see the food I cooked looks and tastes great. Moreover, it is very satisfying to know that I can cook something delicious without help from anyone else. Cooking also allows me to express my creativity and culinary skills. I can be as creative as I want with the food and experiment with different flavors and ingredients. Last but not least, cooking is a great way to bond with family and friends. We can all gather around the kitchen table and enjoy good food and company.
